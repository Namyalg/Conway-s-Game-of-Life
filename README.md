# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life implemented on a finite and infinite grid
 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 The first file , finite_grid.py implements Conways's Game of Life considering a grid of size 15x15 [A Toroidal Array] is used.
 Corresponding snapshots of the implementation using Pygame are also included.
 
 The second file, infinite_grid.py implements Conway's Game of Life consifering an infinite grid
 
 The number of iterations are accepted in both the cases
